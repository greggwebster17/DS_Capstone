# DS_Capstone
PySpark Capstone project as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree 

Installations - no additional libraries are needed to be installed in order for the project code to run.

Project Motivation - in order to predict churn (cancellations) of users for a music streaming service. Project uses PySpark capabilities. Involves creating features, then fitting a Logistic Regression. The best model is chosen using Gini and AUC measures. 

File Descriptions - There is one Python notebook with the relevant code to conduct the data preparation, analysis and model fitting. 

How to Interact with your project - Python notebook has the code and results. A write up of the results can also be found here https://greggwebster17.medium.com/music-app-churn-prediction-using-logistic-regression-e0ac9f374f36

Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.- Credit to Udacity to supplying the data. There are no restrictions to the use of the code supplied here.
